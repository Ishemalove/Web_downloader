e8i0p5k0">Hello.Our next in-person event will occur at the Metro Baptist Church in midtown Manhattan. This building is used as a community space for a mutual aid group I used to volunteer for in the past called Artists Athletes Activists. They help underserved communities and immigrant families who reside in the NYC shelter system with obtaining housing, food, employment, and social services. I&#x27;m still in contact with them, so any assistance they can offer is always welcomed. This next event will focus on how the Codecademy Community can utilize their skills and backgrounds to brainstorm ideas on how to solve social problems in the community and introduce STEM education to families who can benefit from it. Recently, I&#x27;ve been reading articles about how certain programmers have used their skills to create apps and systems to address issues ranging from language translation to building databases about where to food pantries. Since AAA&#x27;s volunteers and staff speak English, Spanish, French, and Arabic, this event would also be a great networking event for multilingual programmers.   ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/This event will focus on three areas of interest:1) Exposing the benefits of coding to children and adults who speak different languages. I thought this would be a great topic on focus on after stumbling on this article about the different languages Khan Academy creates lessons for. Given that not everyone codes in English, this could be seen as a good challenge for anyone on Codecademy to tackle.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in 2) Recently, I came across an article about the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Documented teaming up to create a digital platform to assist refugees and immigrants in accessing multilingual and translated resources so they can find information on jobs, housing, and food/clothing.﻿﻿The platform is called Documented.info, which is linked below. From what I&#x27;ve seen, it feels like a simple and intuitive platform to scroll through, so anyone is free to check it out for themselves. Given what I&#x27;ve noticed in the collaboration section of the Codecademy Community, this platform could serve as an inspiration for anyone wanting to create something similar.      https://www.documented.info/en-us3) This last item is more of a favor to ask from the Codecademy Community. (It also serves as a chance to showcase your work, so you&#x27;re likely to get an opportunity to send out a portfolio or resume if you&#x27;re up for it.) I volunteered remotely for a non-profit group called Project Esperanza last year. To give a quick summary, they assist Haitian students residing in the Dominican Republic so they can get better access to education given what&#x27;s occurred in Haiti the last few years. Their website is linked below. ﻿﻿From my time spent with them, I helped to introduce basic web development to middle-school aged children, most of which actually came from the Codecademy curriculum. I had an idea before of creating a virtual tutring program, but that went out the window when I forgot about them for a while. I haven&#x27;t been in contact with them since then, but they recently had issues with their Instagram account and other social media channels. I&#x27;m hoping the community here can help them resolve these problems since not many people know about their work. If anyone wants to help, the post explaining everything is linked below along with their page.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en﻿﻿I have two other groups that need some help with their pages. Team TLC and Afrikana are two other mutual aid groups I volunteer for sometimes. They have websites that need a bit of an update, particularly when it comes to their UI and full-stack development. I know a space for full-stack developers is growing on here in Codecademy, so I thought I&#x27;d throw this out there for anyone looking to showcase their skills. https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesHope to see you all in-person on Wednesday.﻿﻿مرحبًا.سيقام الحدث التالي الذي سنقيمه شخصيًا في كنيسة مترو بابتيست في وسط مانهاتن. يستخدم هذا المبنى كمساحة مجتمعية لمجموعة مساعدة متبادلة اعتدت أن أتطوع فيها في الماضي تسمى Artists Athletes Activists. يساعدون المجتمعات المحرومة والأسر المهاجرة التي تقيم في نظام ملاجئ مدينة نيويورك في الحصول على السكن والطعام والتوظيف والخدمات الاجتماعية. ما زلت على اتصال بهم، لذا فإن أي مساعدة يمكنهم تقديمها موضع ترحيب دائمًا.سيركز الحدث التالي على كيفية تمكن مجتمع Codecademy من الاستفادة من مهاراتهم وخلفياتهم لتبادل الأفكار حول كيفية حل المشكلات الاجتماعية في المجتمع وتقديم تعليم العلوم والتكنولوجيا والهندسة والرياضيات للأسر التي يمكن أن تستفيد منه. مؤخرًا، كنت أقرأ مقالات حول كيفية استخدام بعض المبرمجين لمهاراتهم لإنشاء تطبيقات وأنظمة لمعالجة قضايا تتراوح من ترجمة اللغة إلى بناء قواعد بيانات حول أماكن مخازن الطعام. نظرًا لأن متطوعي وموظفي AAA يتحدثون الإنجليزية والإسبانية والفرنسية والعربية، فإن هذا الحدث سيكون أيضًا حدثًا رائعًا للتواصل بين المبرمجين متعددي اللغات. ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/ سيركز هذا الحدث على ثلاثة مجالات ذات أهمية:1) الكشف عن فوائد البرمجة للأطفال والبالغين الذين يتحدثون لغات مختلفة. اعتقدت أن هذا سيكون موضوعًا رائعًا للتركيز عليه بعد العثور على هذه المقالة حول اللغات المختلفة التي تنشئ أكاديمية خان دروسًا بها. ونظرًا لأن ليس كل شخص يكتب التعليمات البرمجية باللغة الإنجليزية، فيمكن اعتبار هذا تحديًا جيدًا لأي شخص على أكاديمية كود.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in2) مؤخرًا، صادفت مقالاً عن تعاون لجنة الإنقاذ الدولية (IRC) وDocumented لإنشاء منصة رقمية لمساعدة اللاجئين والمهاجرين في الوصول إلى الموارد المتعددة اللغات والمترجمة حتى يتمكنوا من العثور على معلومات حول الوظائف والإسكان والطعام/الملابس. اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented تطلقان موقع Documented.info لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بموارد موثوقة ومتعددة اللغاتتفخر اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented، وهي غرفة أخبار غير ربحية تقدم تقارير عن مجتمعات المهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك، بالإعلان عن إطلاق Documented.info. صُممت هذه المنصة الرقمية الجديدة لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بمعلومات موثوقة ومتعددة اللغات تغطي كل شيء بدءًا من الوصول إلى المأوى وموارد الصحة العقلية وأهلية التوظيف وحقوق العمل إلى كيفية التنقل في عملية اللجوء وإيجاد الدعم القانوني.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrants تسمى المنصة Documented.info، والتي تم ربطها أدناه. من ما رأيته، يبدو الأمر وكأنه منصة بسيطة وبديهية للتنقل خلالها، لذلك يمكن لأي شخص التحقق منها بنفسه. بالنظر إلى ما لاحظته في قسم التعاون في مجتمع Codecademy، يمكن أن تكون هذه المنصة بمثابة مصدر إلهام لأي شخص يرغب في إنشاء شيء مماثل.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) هذا العنصر الأخير هو أكثر من مجرد خدمة لطلبها من مجتمع Codecademy. (كما أنه بمثابة فرصة لعرض عملك، لذلك من المرجح أن تحصل على فرصة لإرسال محفظة أو سيرة ذاتية إذا كنت مستعدًا لذلك.) لقد تطوعت عن بُعد لمجموعة غير ربحية تسمى Project Esperanza العام الماضي. لإعطاء ملخص سريع، يساعدون الطلاب الهايتيين المقيمين في جمهورية الدومينيكان حتى يتمكنوا من الحصول على وصول أفضل إلى التعليم بالنظر إلى ما حدث في هايتي في السنوات القليلة الماضية. موقعهم على الويب مرتبط أدناه. تطوع عن بُعدإذا لم تتمكن من قضاء بعض الوقت في بويرتو بلاتا معنا ولكنك ترغب في استخدام وقتك لمساعدة المنظمة، فهناك طرق يمكنك القيام بذلك بها! إليك بعض الطرق التي يمكنك من خلالها المساعدة: تطوير...https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ من خلال الوقت الذي أمضيته معهم، ساعدت في تقديم تطوير الويب الأساسي للأطفال في سن المدرسة المتوسطة، ومعظم هذه الدروس جاءت في الواقع من منهج Codecademy. كانت لدي فكرة من قبل لإنشاء برنامج تعليمي افتراضي، لكن الفكرة ذهبت أدراج الرياح عندما نسيت أمرهم لفترة. لم أكن على اتصال بهم منذ ذلك الحين، لكنهم واجهوا مؤخرًا مشكلات مع حسابهم على Instagram وقنوات التواصل الاجتماعي الأخرى. آمل أن يتمكن المجتمع هنا من مساعدتهم في حل هذه المشكلات نظرًا لأن ليس الكثير من الناس يعرفون عن عملهم. إذا أراد أي شخص المساعدة، فإن المنشور الذي يشرح كل شيء مرتبط أدناه مع صفحتهم.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  لدي مجموعتان أخريان تحتاجان إلى بعض المساعدة في صفحاتهما. فريق TLC وAfrikana هما مجموعتان أخريان للمساعدة المتبادلة أتطوع فيهما أحيانًا. إنهم لديهم مواقع ويب تحتاج إلى بعض التحديث، وخاصةً عندما يتعلق الأمر بواجهة المستخدم والتطوير الكامل. أعلم أن هناك مساحة للمطورين الكاملين ينمون هنا في Codecademy، لذا فقد فكرت في طرح هذا الموضوع لأي شخص يتطلع إلى عرض مهاراته.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesأتمنى أن أراكم جميعًا شخصيًا يوم الأربعاء.﻿﻿Bonjour.Notre prochain événement en personne aura lieu à la Metro Baptist Church, dans le centre de Manhattan. Ce bâtiment est utilisé comme espace communautaire pour un groupe d&#x27;entraide pour lequel j&#x27;ai fait du bénévolat dans le passé, appelé Artists Athletes Activists. Ils aident les communautés mal desservies et les familles d&#x27;immigrants qui résident dans le système d&#x27;hébergement de New York à obtenir un logement, de la nourriture, un emploi et des services sociaux. Je suis toujours en contact avec eux, donc toute aide qu&#x27;ils peuvent offrir est toujours la bienvenue.Ce prochain événement se concentrera sur la façon dont la communauté Codecademy peut utiliser ses compétences et son expérience pour réfléchir à des idées sur la façon de résoudre les problèmes sociaux dans la communauté et de présenter l&#x27;éducation STEM aux familles qui peuvent en bénéficier. Récemment, j&#x27;ai lu des articles sur la façon dont certains programmeurs ont utilisé leurs compétences pour créer des applications et des systèmes pour résoudre des problèmes allant de la traduction linguistique à la création de bases de données sur les banques alimentaires. Étant donné que les bénévoles et le personnel de AAA parlent anglais, espagnol, français et arabe, cet événement serait également un excellent événement de réseautage pour les programmeurs multilingües. ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/ Cet événement se concentrera sur trois domaines d&#x27;intérêt :1) Exposer les avantages du codage aux enfants et aux adultes qui parlent différentes langues. J&#x27;ai pensé que ce serait un excellent sujet sur lequel me concentrer après être tombé sur cet article sur les différentes langues pour lesquelles Khan Academy crée des cours. Étant donné que tout le monde ne code pas en anglais, cela pourrait être considéré comme un bon défi à relever pour quiconque sur Codecademy.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in2) Récemment, je suis tombé sur un article sur l&#x27;International Rescue Committee (IRC) et Documented qui se sont associés pour créer une plateforme numérique pour aider les réfugiés et les immigrants à accéder à des ressources multilingues et traduites afin qu&#x27;ils puissent trouver des informations sur les emplois, le logement et la nourriture/les vêtements.L&#x27;IRC et Documented lancent Documented.info pour fournir aux demandeurs d&#x27;asile et aux migrants de New York des ressources fiables et multilinguesL&#x27;International Rescue Committee (IRC) et Documented, une salle de presse à but non lucratif qui rend compte des communautés immigrées de New York, sont fiers d&#x27;annoncer le lancement de Documented.info. Cette nouvelle plateforme numérique est conçue pour fournir aux demandeurs d&#x27;asile et aux migrants de New York des informations fiables et multilingues couvrant tout, de l&#x27;accès aux abris et aux ressources de santé mentale, à l&#x27;éligibilité à l&#x27;emploi et aux droits du travail, en passant par la façon de naviguer dans le processus d&#x27;asile et de trouver une assistance juridique.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrantsLa plateforme s&#x27;appelle Documented.info, dont le lien est ci-dessous. D&#x27;après ce que j&#x27;ai vu, elle semble être une plateforme simple et intuitive à parcourir, donc chacun est libre de la consulter par lui-même. Compte tenu de ce que j&#x27;ai remarqué dans la section collaboration de la communauté Codecademy, cette plateforme pourrait servir d&#x27;inspiration à quiconque souhaite créer quelque chose de similaire.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) Ce dernier élément est plutôt une faveur à demander à la communauté Codecademy. (Il sert également d&#x27;occasion de présenter votre travail, vous aurez donc probablement l&#x27;occasion d&#x27;envoyer un portfolio ou un CV si vous le souhaitez.) J&#x27;ai fait du bénévolat à distance pour un groupe à but non lucratif appelé Project Esperanza l&#x27;année dernière. Pour résumer rapidement, ils aident les étudiants haïtiens résidant en République dominicaine afin qu&#x27;ils puissent avoir un meilleur accès à l&#x27;éducation compte tenu de ce qui s&#x27;est passé en Haïti ces dernières années. Leur site Web est lié ci-dessous.

J&#x27;avais déjà eu l&#x27;idée de créer un programme de tutorat virtuel, mais cela a été abandonné lorsque je les ai oubliés pendant un certain temps. Je n&#x27;ai pas été en contact avec eux depuis, mais ils ont récemment eu des problèmes avec leur compte Instagram et d&#x27;autres canaux de médias sociaux.

Team TLC et Afrikana sont deux autres groupes d&#x27;entraide pour lesquels je fais parfois du bénévolat. Ils ont des sites Web qui ont besoin d&#x27;une petite mise à jour, notamment en ce qui concerne leur interface utilisateur et leur développement full-stack. Je sais qu&#x27;un espace pour les développeurs full-stack se développe ici sur Codecademy, alors j&#x27;ai pensé que je le proposerais à tous ceux qui cherchent à mettre en valeur leurs compétences.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesJ&#x27;espère vous voir tous en personne mercredi.  ﻿﻿Hola.Nuestro próximo evento presencial se llevará a cabo en la Iglesia Bautista Metro en el centro de Manhattan. Este edificio se utiliza como espacio comunitario para un grupo de ayuda mutua en el que solía trabajar como voluntario en el pasado llamado Artists Athletes Activists. Ayudan a las comunidades desfavorecidas y a las familias inmigrantes que residen en el sistema de refugios de la ciudad de Nueva York a obtener vivienda, comida, empleo y servicios sociales. Todavía estoy en contacto con ellos, por lo que cualquier ayuda que puedan ofrecer siempre es bienvenida.Este próximo evento se centrará en cómo la comunidad de Codecademy puede utilizar sus habilidades y antecedentes para generar ideas sobre cómo resolver problemas sociales en la comunidad y presentar la educación STEM a las familias que pueden beneficiarse de ella. Recientemente, he estado leyendo artículos sobre cómo ciertos programadores han utilizado sus habilidades para crear aplicaciones y sistemas para abordar problemas que van desde la traducción de idiomas hasta la creación de bases de datos sobre dónde encontrar despensas de alimentos.

Teniendo en cuenta lo que he notado en la sección de colaboración de la Comunidad Codecademy, esta plataforma podría servir como inspiración para cualquiera que quiera crear algo similar.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) Este último punto es más bien un favor que pedirle a la Comunidad Codecademy. (También sirve como una oportunidad para mostrar tu trabajo, por lo que es probable que tengas la oportunidad de enviar un portafolio o un currículum si estás dispuesto a hacerlo). El año pasado me ofrecí como voluntario de forma remota para un grupo sin fines de lucro llamado Proyecto Esperanza. Para dar un resumen rápido, ayudan a los estudiantes haitianos que residen en la República Dominicana para que puedan tener un mejor acceso a la educación dada la situación que ha ocurrido en Haití en los últimos años.

Estas son algunas de las formas en las que puedes ayudar: Desarrollando...https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ Durante el tiempo que pasé con ellos, ayudé a introducir el desarrollo web básico a niños de secundaria, la mayoría de los cuales en realidad provenían del plan de estudios de Codecademy. Antes tenía una idea de crear un programa de tutoría virtual, pero eso se fue por la ventana cuando me olvidé de ellos por un tiempo. No he estado en contacto con ellos desde entonces, pero recientemente tuvieron problemas con su cuenta de Instagram y otros canales de redes sociales. Espero que la comunidad aquí pueda ayudarlos a resolver estos problemas, ya que no muchas personas conocen su trabajo. Si alguien quiere ayudar, la publicación que explica todo está vinculada a continuación junto con su página.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  Tengo otros dos grupos que necesitan ayuda con sus páginas. Team TLC y Afrikana son otros dos grupos de ayuda mutua para los que a veces trabajo como voluntario. Tienen sitios web que necesitan una pequeña actualización, en particular en lo que respecta a su interfaz de usuario y desarrollo full-stack.

This event is purposefully scheduled at 6:45PM to include an additional 15 minutes for preparation before the hour long interactive session.No prior experience with Git is needed, though very helpful!</span></div><div tabindex="0" class="gamut-13ph72e-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div aria-label="youtube event" aria-hidden="false" class="gamut-u5bnzm-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="YoutubePlayIcon-mask-:Rplajajplatbalb9l6:"><path d="M23.25 7.44A3.44 3.44 0 0019.81 4H4.19A3.44 3.44 0 00.75 7.44v9.12A3.44 3.44 0 004.19 20h15.62a3.44 3.44 0 003.44-3.44zM9.5 15.94V7.28l6.77 4.33z" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path></mask><g mask="url(#YoutubePlayIcon-mask-:Rplajajplatbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>YouTube</div><span class="gamut-1v17pbd-StyledText e8i0p5k0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="PeopleIcon-mask-:Rqlajajplatbalb9l6:"><path d="M14.251 4.416a4.125 4.125 0 11.756 7.305M15 13.667a6.757 6.757 0 018.25 6.583" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M14.248 6.834a6.807 6.807 0 003.627 1.041 6.843 6.843 0 002.712-.558M.75 20.25a6.75 6.75 0 0113.5 0M3.388 8.2l-.012.778a5.9 5.9 0 01-.859 3.272m9.106-4.264v1a5.9 5.9 0 00.86 3.272M3.388 8.2A5.483 5.483 0 007.5 6.305a5.483 5.483 0 004.112 1.9" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path><circle cx="7.5" cy="7.875" r="4.125" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></circle></mask><g mask="url(#PeopleIcon-mask-:Rqlajajplatbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>20</span></div></div></a></div></li><li class="gamut-1qq94n1-StyledColumn e1y0e4q30"><div class="e7wsep41 eeujxae0 gamut-z8kzyl-VariableProvider-CardWrapper e1skjn880"><a href="https://community.codecademy.com/c/events/codecademy-coding-hangout-e29511" target="_blank" class="e7wsep40 gamut-s2640a-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0"><div class="gamut-ltxqj-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div class="gamut-lajw5q-Box ebnwbv90"><h3 class="gamut-12cj34z-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Codecademy Coding Hangout: Jazz Jam Session</h3><div class="gamut-9u2q54-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div class="gamut-jniw0z-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="CalendarIcon-mask-:Rpjjajak9latbalb9l6:"><rect x="0.75" y="3.75" width="22.5" height="19.5" rx="1.5" ry="1.5" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></rect><path fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" d="M.75 9.75h22.5M6.75 6V.75M17.25 6V.75M5.625 13.5h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375M12 13.5h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375A.375.375 0 0012 13.5m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m6.375-5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375"></path></mask><g mask="url(#CalendarIcon-mask-:Rpjjajak9latbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>Nov 21, 2024</div>7-8pm</div><span class="gamut-sc0d07-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Event Overview:Join us for a Codecademy Coding Hangout!

Given a recent member&#x27;s recommendation of hosting an in-person event at a cafe or eatery, I thought this would be a great choice to host such an occasion.  ﻿﻿The topic of the event will focus on discussing ways members of the Codecademy Community can utilize their coding backgrounds to implement solutions to issues affecting the local community, foster STEM mentorship in the youth residing in the area, and assist several non-profits I previously volunteered for. This event could even lead to showcasing your coding portfolios and projects to anyone interested in seeing them.﻿﻿A few blocks away from The Clubhouse Cafe, a vacant property is currently looking for anyone interested in seeking a lease. As someone who recently viewed a Codecademy Community event focused on entrepreneurs, I thought this in-person event could also serve as a chance to discuss how to build a space for coders looking to connect and network. Since The Knowledge House is also based in The Bronx, a tech community in the South Bronx could benefit from the collaboration between the Codecademy Community and larger swaths of the tech sector in the borough.https://www.theknowledgehouse.org/our_story/Finally, Oyate Group is an opportunity for anyone in the Codecademy space to see what ideas they can turn to life with the right support. Based in the South Bronx just like The Knowledge House, Oyate Group is a non-profit that strives to provide resources and solutions to underserved communities seeking to alleviate poverty and invest in entrepreneurial endeavors. Not only does Oyate Group provide capital and training to startup founders, they also host an event space that could serve as another in-person event location for our next session in the future.     ﻿﻿</span></div><div tabindex="0" class="gamut-13ph72e-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div aria-label="youtube event" aria-hidden="false" class="gamut-u5bnzm-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="YoutubePlayIcon-mask-:Rplajalplatbalb9l6:"><path d="M23.25 7.44A3.44 3.44 0 0019.81 4H4.19A3.44 3.44 0 00.75 7.44v9.12A3.44 3.44 0 004.19 20h15.62a3.44 3.44 0 003.44-3.44zM9.5 15.94V7.28l6.77 4.33z" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path></mask><g mask="url(#YoutubePlayIcon-mask-:Rplajalplatbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>YouTube</div><span class="gamut-1v17pbd-StyledText e8i0p5k0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="PeopleIcon-mask-:Rqlajalplatbalb9l6:"><path d="M14.251 4.416a4.125 4.125 0 11.756 7.305M15 13.667a6.757 6.757 0 018.25 6.583" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M14.248 6.834a6.807 6.807 0 003.627 1.041 6.843 6.843 0 002.712-.558M.75 20.25a6.75 6.75 0 0113.5 0M3.388 8.2l-.012.778a5.9 5.9 0 01-.859 3.272m9.106-4.264v1a5.9 5.9 0 00.86 3.272M3.388 8.2A5.483 5.483 0 007.5 6.305a5.483 5.483 0 004.112 1.9" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></path><circle cx="7.5" cy="7.875" r="4.125" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></circle></mask><g mask="url(#PeopleIcon-mask-:Rqlajalplatbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>5</span></div></div></a></div></li><li class="gamut-1qq94n1-StyledColumn e1y0e4q30"><div class="e7wsep41 eeujxae0 gamut-z8kzyl-VariableProvider-CardWrapper e1skjn880"><a href="https://community.codecademy.com/c/events/study-hour-code-connect-session" target="_blank" class="e7wsep40 gamut-s2640a-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0"><div class="gamut-ltxqj-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div class="gamut-lajw5q-Box ebnwbv90"><h3 class="gamut-12cj34z-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Johannesburg Club Event: Study Hour 🖥️</h3><div class="gamut-9u2q54-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><div class="gamut-jniw0z-FlexBox e1tc6bzh0"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" role="img" aria-hidden="true" class="gamut-uhjc5m eol2zvm0"><mask id="CalendarIcon-mask-:Rpjjajam9latbalb9l6:"><rect x="0.75" y="3.75" width="22.5" height="19.5" rx="1.5" ry="1.5" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5"></rect><path fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" d="M.75 9.75h22.5M6.75 6V.75M17.25 6V.75M5.625 13.5h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375M12 13.5h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375A.375.375 0 0012 13.5m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m6.375-5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375m0 5.25h0m0 0a.375.375 0 10.375.375.375.375 0 00-.375-.375"></path></mask><g mask="url(#CalendarIcon-mask-:Rpjjajam9latbalb9l6:)"><rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="currentColor"></rect></g></svg>Nov 20, 2024</div>4-5:30pm</div><span class="gamut-sc0d07-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Hey everyone💫 We’re hosting a Study Hour - Code Connect Session next Wednesday from 6 PM to 7:30 PM, and we’d love for you to join! 🎉Here’s the plan:✨ 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Focused study time, perfect for tackling your Codecademy courses, projects, or anything you’re working on.✨ 7:00 PM - 7:30 PM: Share your progress, exchange ideas, and get inspired by the community!📅 When?

This building is used as a community space for a mutual aid group I used to volunteer for in the past called Artists Athletes Activists. They help underserved communities and immigrant families who reside in the NYC shelter system with obtaining housing, food, employment, and social services. I'm still in contact with them, so any assistance they can offer is always welcomed. This next event will focus on how the Codecademy Community can utilize their skills and backgrounds to brainstorm ideas on how to solve social problems in the community and introduce STEM education to families who can benefit from it. Recently, I've been reading articles about how certain programmers have used their skills to create apps and systems to address issues ranging from language translation to building databases about where to food pantries. Since AAA's volunteers and staff speak English, Spanish, French, and Arabic, this event would also be a great networking event for multilingual programmers.   ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/This event will focus on three areas of interest:1) Exposing the benefits of coding to children and adults who speak different languages. I thought this would be a great topic on focus on after stumbling on this article about the different languages Khan Academy creates lessons for. Given that not everyone codes in English, this could be seen as a good challenge for anyone on Codecademy to tackle.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in 2) Recently, I came across an article about the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Documented teaming up to create a digital platform to assist refugees and immigrants in accessing multilingual and translated resources so they can find information on jobs, housing, and food/clothing.﻿﻿The platform is called Documented.info, which is linked below. From what I've seen, it feels like a simple and intuitive platform to scroll through, so anyone is free to check it out for themselves. Given what I've noticed in the collaboration section of the Codecademy Community, this platform could serve as an inspiration for anyone wanting to create something similar.      https://www.documented.info/en-us3) This last item is more of a favor to ask from the Codecademy Community. (It also serves as a chance to showcase your work, so you're likely to get an opportunity to send out a portfolio or resume if you're up for it.) I volunteered remotely for a non-profit group called Project Esperanza last year. To give a quick summary, they assist Haitian students residing in the Dominican Republic so they can get better access to education given what's occurred in Haiti the last few years. Their website is linked below. ﻿﻿From my time spent with them, I helped to introduce basic web development to middle-school aged children, most of which actually came from the Codecademy curriculum. I had an idea before of creating a virtual tutring program, but that went out the window when I forgot about them for a while. I haven't been in contact with them since then, but they recently had issues with their Instagram account and other social media channels. I'm hoping the community here can help them resolve these problems since not many people know about their work. If anyone wants to help, the post explaining everything is linked below along with their page.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en﻿﻿I have two other groups that need some help with their pages. Team TLC and Afrikana are two other mutual aid groups I volunteer for sometimes. They have websites that need a bit of an update, particularly when it comes to their UI and full-stack development. I know a space for full-stack developers is growing on here in Codecademy, so I thought I'd throw this out there for anyone looking to showcase their skills. https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesHope to see you all in-person on Wednesday.﻿﻿مرحبًا.سيقام الحدث التالي الذي سنقيمه شخصيًا في كنيسة مترو بابتيست في وسط مانهاتن. يستخدم هذا المبنى كمساحة مجتمعية لمجموعة مساعدة متبادلة اعتدت أن أتطوع فيها في الماضي تسمى Artists Athletes Activists. يساعدون المجتمعات المحرومة والأسر المهاجرة التي تقيم في نظام ملاجئ مدينة نيويورك في الحصول على السكن والطعام والتوظيف والخدمات الاجتماعية. ما زلت على اتصال بهم، لذا فإن أي مساعدة يمكنهم تقديمها موضع ترحيب دائمًا.سيركز الحدث التالي على كيفية تمكن مجتمع Codecademy من الاستفادة من مهاراتهم وخلفياتهم لتبادل الأفكار حول كيفية حل المشكلات الاجتماعية في المجتمع وتقديم تعليم العلوم والتكنولوجيا والهندسة والرياضيات للأسر التي يمكن أن تستفيد منه. مؤخرًا، كنت أقرأ مقالات حول كيفية استخدام بعض المبرمجين لمهاراتهم لإنشاء تطبيقات وأنظمة لمعالجة قضايا تتراوح من ترجمة اللغة إلى بناء قواعد بيانات حول أماكن مخازن الطعام. نظرًا لأن متطوعي وموظفي AAA يتحدثون الإنجليزية والإسبانية والفرنسية والعربية، فإن هذا الحدث سيكون أيضًا حدثًا رائعًا للتواصل بين المبرمجين متعددي اللغات. ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/ سيركز هذا الحدث على ثلاثة مجالات ذات أهمية:1) الكشف عن فوائد البرمجة للأطفال والبالغين الذين يتحدثون لغات مختلفة. اعتقدت أن هذا سيكون موضوعًا رائعًا للتركيز عليه بعد العثور على هذه المقالة حول اللغات المختلفة التي تنشئ أكاديمية خان دروسًا بها. ونظرًا لأن ليس كل شخص يكتب التعليمات البرمجية باللغة الإنجليزية، فيمكن اعتبار هذا تحديًا جيدًا لأي شخص على أكاديمية كود.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in2) مؤخرًا، صادفت مقالاً عن تعاون لجنة الإنقاذ الدولية (IRC) وDocumented لإنشاء منصة رقمية لمساعدة اللاجئين والمهاجرين في الوصول إلى الموارد المتعددة اللغات والمترجمة حتى يتمكنوا من العثور على معلومات حول الوظائف والإسكان والطعام/الملابس. اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented تطلقان موقع Documented.info لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بموارد موثوقة ومتعددة اللغاتتفخر اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented، وهي غرفة أخبار غير ربحية تقدم تقارير عن مجتمعات المهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك، بالإعلان عن إطلاق Documented.info. صُممت هذه المنصة الرقمية الجديدة لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بمعلومات موثوقة ومتعددة اللغات تغطي كل شيء بدءًا من الوصول إلى المأوى وموارد الصحة العقلية وأهلية التوظيف وحقوق العمل إلى كيفية التنقل في عملية اللجوء وإيجاد الدعم القانوني.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrants تسمى المنصة Documented.info، والتي تم ربطها أدناه. من ما رأيته، يبدو الأمر وكأنه منصة بسيطة وبديهية للتنقل خلالها، لذلك يمكن لأي شخص التحقق منها بنفسه. بالنظر إلى ما لاحظته في قسم التعاون في مجتمع Codecademy، يمكن أن تكون هذه المنصة بمثابة مصدر إلهام لأي شخص يرغب في إنشاء شيء مماثل.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) هذا العنصر الأخير هو أكثر من مجرد خدمة لطلبها من مجتمع Codecademy. (كما أنه بمثابة فرصة لعرض عملك، لذلك من المرجح أن تحصل على فرصة لإرسال محفظة أو سيرة ذاتية إذا كنت مستعدًا لذلك.) لقد تطوعت عن بُعد لمجموعة غير ربحية تسمى Project Esperanza العام الماضي. لإعطاء ملخص سريع، يساعدون الطلاب الهايتيين المقيمين في جمهورية الدومينيكان حتى يتمكنوا من الحصول على وصول أفضل إلى التعليم بالنظر إلى ما حدث في هايتي في السنوات القليلة الماضية. موقعهم على الويب مرتبط أدناه. تطوع عن بُعدإذا لم تتمكن من قضاء بعض الوقت في بويرتو بلاتا معنا ولكنك ترغب في استخدام وقتك لمساعدة المنظمة، فهناك طرق يمكنك القيام بذلك بها! إليك بعض الطرق التي يمكنك من خلالها المساعدة: تطوير...https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ من خلال الوقت الذي أمضيته معهم، ساعدت في تقديم تطوير الويب الأساسي للأطفال في سن المدرسة المتوسطة، ومعظم هذه الدروس جاءت في الواقع من منهج Codecademy. كانت لدي فكرة من قبل لإنشاء برنامج تعليمي افتراضي، لكن الفكرة ذهبت أدراج الرياح عندما نسيت أمرهم لفترة. لم أكن على اتصال بهم منذ ذلك الحين، لكنهم واجهوا مؤخرًا مشكلات مع حسابهم على Instagram وقنوات التواصل الاجتماعي الأخرى. آمل أن يتمكن المجتمع هنا من مساعدتهم في حل هذه المشكلات نظرًا لأن ليس الكثير من الناس يعرفون عن عملهم. إذا أراد أي شخص المساعدة، فإن المنشور الذي يشرح كل شيء مرتبط أدناه مع صفحتهم.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  لدي مجموعتان أخريان تحتاجان إلى بعض المساعدة في صفحاتهما. فريق TLC وAfrikana هما مجموعتان أخريان للمساعدة المتبادلة أتطوع فيهما أحيانًا. إنهم لديهم مواقع ويب تحتاج إلى بعض التحديث، وخاصةً عندما يتعلق الأمر بواجهة المستخدم والتطوير الكامل. أعلم أن هناك مساحة للمطورين الكاملين ينمون هنا في Codecademy، لذا فقد فكرت في طرح هذا الموضوع لأي شخص يتطلع إلى عرض مهاراته.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesأتمنى أن أراكم جميعًا شخصيًا يوم الأربعاء.﻿﻿Bonjour.Notre prochain événement en personne aura lieu à la Metro Baptist Church, dans le centre de Manhattan. Ce bâtiment est utilisé comme espace communautaire pour un groupe d'entraide pour lequel j'ai fait du bénévolat dans le passé, appelé Artists Athletes Activists. Ils aident les communautés mal desservies et les familles d'immigrants qui résident dans le système d'hébergement de New York à obtenir un logement, de la nourriture, un emploi et des services sociaux.

Récemment, j'ai lu des articles sur la façon dont certains programmeurs ont utilisé leurs compétences pour créer des applications et des systèmes pour résoudre des problèmes allant de la traduction linguistique à la création de bases de données sur les banques alimentaires. Étant donné que les bénévoles et le personnel de AAA parlent anglais, espagnol, français et arabe, cet événement serait également un excellent événement de réseautage pour les programmeurs multilingües. ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/ Cet événement se concentrera sur trois domaines d'intérêt :1) Exposer les avantages du codage aux enfants et aux adultes qui parlent différentes langues. J'ai pensé que ce serait un excellent sujet sur lequel me concentrer après être tombé sur cet article sur les différentes langues pour lesquelles Khan Academy crée des cours.

Cette nouvelle plateforme numérique est conçue pour fournir aux demandeurs d'asile et aux migrants de New York des informations fiables et multilingues couvrant tout, de l'accès aux abris et aux ressources de santé mentale, à l'éligibilité à l'emploi et aux droits du travail, en passant par la façon de naviguer dans le processus d'asile et de trouver une assistance juridique.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrantsLa plateforme s'appelle Documented.info, dont le lien est ci-dessous. D'après ce que j'ai vu, elle semble être une plateforme simple et intuitive à parcourir, donc chacun est libre de la consulter par lui-même. Compte tenu de ce que j'ai remarqué dans la section collaboration de la communauté Codecademy, cette plateforme pourrait servir d'inspiration à quiconque souhaite créer quelque chose de similaire.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) Ce dernier élément est plutôt une faveur à demander à la communauté Codecademy. (Il sert également d'occasion de présenter votre travail, vous aurez donc probablement l'occasion d'envoyer un portfolio ou un CV si vous le souhaitez.) J'ai fait du bénévolat à distance pour un groupe à but non lucratif appelé Project Esperanza l'année dernière. Pour résumer rapidement, ils aident les étudiants haïtiens résidant en République dominicaine afin qu'ils puissent avoir un meilleur accès à l'éducation compte tenu de ce qui s'est passé en Haïti ces dernières années. Leur site Web est lié ci-dessous.

Voici quelques-unes des façons dont vous pouvez aider : Développer …https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ Du temps que j'ai passé avec eux, j'ai aidé à présenter le développement Web de base aux enfants d'âge moyen, dont la plupart provenaient en fait du programme Codecademy. J'avais déjà eu l'idée de créer un programme de tutorat virtuel, mais cela a été abandonné lorsque je les ai oubliés pendant un certain temps. Je n'ai pas été en contact avec eux depuis, mais ils ont récemment eu des problèmes avec leur compte Instagram et d'autres canaux de médias sociaux. J'espère que la communauté ici pourra les aider à résoudre ces problèmes car peu de gens connaissent leur travail. Si quelqu'un veut aider, le message expliquant tout est lié ci-dessous avec leur page.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  J'ai deux autres groupes qui ont besoin d'aide avec leurs pages. Team TLC et Afrikana sont deux autres groupes d'entraide pour lesquels je fais parfois du bénévolat. Ils ont des sites Web qui ont besoin d'une petite mise à jour, notamment en ce qui concerne leur interface utilisateur et leur développement full-stack. Je sais qu'un espace pour les développeurs full-stack se développe ici sur Codecademy, alors j'ai pensé que je le proposerais à tous ceux qui cherchent à mettre en valeur leurs compétences.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesJ'espère vous voir tous en personne mercredi.  ﻿﻿Hola.Nuestro próximo evento presencial se llevará a cabo en la Iglesia Bautista Metro en el centro de Manhattan.

Esta nueva plataforma digital está diseñada para proporcionar a los solicitantes de asilo y migrantes en la ciudad de Nueva York información confiable y multilingüe que abarca todo, desde el acceso a refugios y recursos de salud mental, la elegibilidad para el empleo y los derechos laborales hasta cómo navegar por el proceso de asilo y encontrar apoyo legal.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrants La plataforma se llama Documented.info, cuyo enlace se encuentra a continuación. Por lo que he visto, parece una plataforma simple e intuitiva para navegar, por lo que cualquiera puede consultarla por sí mismo. Teniendo en cuenta lo que he notado en la sección de colaboración de la Comunidad Codecademy, esta plataforma podría servir como inspiración para cualquiera que quiera crear algo similar.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) Este último punto es más bien un favor que pedirle a la Comunidad Codecademy. (También sirve como una oportunidad para mostrar tu trabajo, por lo que es probable que tengas la oportunidad de enviar un portafolio o un currículum si estás dispuesto a hacerlo). El año pasado me ofrecí como voluntario de forma remota para un grupo sin fines de lucro llamado Proyecto Esperanza. Para dar un resumen rápido, ayudan a los estudiantes haitianos que residen en la República Dominicana para que puedan tener un mejor acceso a la educación dada la situación que ha ocurrido en Haití en los últimos años. Su sitio web está vinculado a continuación. Ofrécete como voluntario de forma remotaSi no puedes pasar tiempo en Puerto Plata con nosotros, pero te gustaría usar tu tiempo para ayudar a la organización, ¡hay formas de hacerlo! Estas son algunas de las formas en las que puedes ayudar: Desarrollando...https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ Durante el tiempo que pasé con ellos, ayudé a introducir el desarrollo web básico a niños de secundaria, la mayoría de los cuales en realidad provenían del plan de estudios de Codecademy. Antes tenía una idea de crear un programa de tutoría virtual, pero eso se fue por la ventana cuando me olvidé de ellos por un tiempo. No he estado en contacto con ellos desde entonces, pero recientemente tuvieron problemas con su cuenta de Instagram y otros canales de redes sociales. Espero que la comunidad aquí pueda ayudarlos a resolver estos problemas, ya que no muchas personas conocen su trabajo. Si alguien quiere ayudar, la publicación que explica todo está vinculada a continuación junto con su página.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  Tengo otros dos grupos que necesitan ayuda con sus páginas. Team TLC y Afrikana son otros dos grupos de ayuda mutua para los que a veces trabajo como voluntario. Tienen sitios web que necesitan una pequeña actualización, en particular en lo que respecta a su interfaz de usuario y desarrollo full-stack. Sé que en Codecademy está creciendo un espacio para desarrolladores full-stack, así que pensé en comentar esto para cualquiera que quiera mostrar sus habilidades.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesEspero verlos a todos en persona el miércoles. ","inPersonLocation":"410 W 40th St, New York, USA","tags":[]},{"__typename":"CommunityEvent","audienceType":"live_stream","id":"16731044","title":"Study Hour - Code Connect Session 💻✨ | JHB CLUB","type":"YouTube","startDate":"2024-12-04T16:15:00Z","endDate":"2024-12-04T17:30:00Z","url":"https://community.codecademy.com/c/events/weekly-study-session","totalAttendees":6,"descriptionShort":"Hey everyone! 💫We’re hosting a Study Hour - Code Connect Session on 4 December 2024 from 6:15 PM to 7:30 PM, and we’d love for you to join! 🎉Here’s the plan:✨ 6:15 PM - 7:15 PM: Focused work time—perfect for tackling your projects, assignments, or anything you’re working on.✨ 7:15 PM - 7:30 PM: Share your progress, exchange ideas, and get inspired by the community! 🚀📅 When? 4 December 2024, 6:15 PM - 7:30 PM📍 Where?

Given a recent member's recommendation of hosting an in-person event at a cafe or eatery, I thought this would be a great choice to host such an occasion.  ﻿﻿The topic of the event will focus on discussing ways members of the Codecademy Community can utilize their coding backgrounds to implement solutions to issues affecting the local community, foster STEM mentorship in the youth residing in the area, and assist several non-profits I previously volunteered for. This event could even lead to showcasing your coding portfolios and projects to anyone interested in seeing them.﻿﻿A few blocks away from The Clubhouse Cafe, a vacant property is currently looking for anyone interested in seeking a lease. As someone who recently viewed a Codecademy Community event focused on entrepreneurs, I thought this in-person event could also serve as a chance to discuss how to build a space for coders looking to connect and network.

Like many of you, I've fallen in love with coding through Codecademy - it's amazing how empowering it feels to build things with code! But with great power comes great responsibility (yes, I went there 🦸‍♂️). As we learn HOW to code, it's crucial to think about WHY and WHAT we're building.🎮 As a volunteer, I've spent the past year running workshops about tech's social and environmental impact. I'm here to share what I've learned through:- Interactive games spotting AI biases- Real cases of GenAI gone wrong (spoiler: it's not just about funny image fails!)- Role-play scenarios that'll make you question default solutions- Open discussions about ethical dilemmas in tech💭 We'll explore real questions like:- When is AI actually NOT the answer?- How can well-intentioned projects have unexpected negative impacts?- What happens when we apply AI in sensitive areas like education or healthcare?- How can we build more inclusive and responsible tech?🌱 This isn't about being perfect - it's about being conscious. Whether you're writing your first line of code or building complex systems, these discussions matter. This is an opportunity to learn together how to drive responsible digital transformation!🗣️ Bring your questions, doubts, and experiences.

Pick a side project YouTube tutorial (ugh, I know) that you've saved and never looked at. Enroll ✅ and sit back, relax. Next week we'll start the actual challenge of committing one hour every day. That means you have one week to prepare: get all your excuses out, fix your schedules, set your alarms and get in the right mindset.The community we're creating here is ready to support you, answer questions when you're stuck, share your progress and mini wins (we love small wins here, just as much as big wins). Depending on turnout, we'll switch out times/days, share prompts and exercises etc. Maybe you'll just join the event to run in the background while you silently work on your course/project - awesome, I'll see you there!

This building is used as a community space for a mutual aid group I used to volunteer for in the past called Artists Athletes Activists. They help underserved communities and immigrant families who reside in the NYC shelter system with obtaining housing, food, employment, and social services. I'm still in contact with them, so any assistance they can offer is always welcomed. This next event will focus on how the Codecademy Community can utilize their skills and backgrounds to brainstorm ideas on how to solve social problems in the community and introduce STEM education to families who can benefit from it. Recently, I've been reading articles about how certain programmers have used their skills to create apps and systems to address issues ranging from language translation to building databases about where to food pantries. Since AAA's volunteers and staff speak English, Spanish, French, and Arabic, this event would also be a great networking event for multilingual programmers.   ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/This event will focus on three areas of interest:1) Exposing the benefits of coding to children and adults who speak different languages. I thought this would be a great topic on focus on after stumbling on this article about the different languages Khan Academy creates lessons for. Given that not everyone codes in English, this could be seen as a good challenge for anyone on Codecademy to tackle.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in 2) Recently, I came across an article about the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Documented teaming up to create a digital platform to assist refugees and immigrants in accessing multilingual and translated resources so they can find information on jobs, housing, and food/clothing.﻿﻿The platform is called Documented.info, which is linked below. From what I've seen, it feels like a simple and intuitive platform to scroll through, so anyone is free to check it out for themselves. Given what I've noticed in the collaboration section of the Codecademy Community, this platform could serve as an inspiration for anyone wanting to create something similar.      https://www.documented.info/en-us3) This last item is more of a favor to ask from the Codecademy Community. (It also serves as a chance to showcase your work, so you're likely to get an opportunity to send out a portfolio or resume if you're up for it.) I volunteered remotely for a non-profit group called Project Esperanza last year. To give a quick summary, they assist Haitian students residing in the Dominican Republic so they can get better access to education given what's occurred in Haiti the last few years. Their website is linked below. ﻿﻿From my time spent with them, I helped to introduce basic web development to middle-school aged children, most of which actually came from the Codecademy curriculum. I had an idea before of creating a virtual tutring program, but that went out the window when I forgot about them for a while. I haven't been in contact with them since then, but they recently had issues with their Instagram account and other social media channels. I'm hoping the community here can help them resolve these problems since not many people know about their work. If anyone wants to help, the post explaining everything is linked below along with their page.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en﻿﻿I have two other groups that need some help with their pages. Team TLC and Afrikana are two other mutual aid groups I volunteer for sometimes. They have websites that need a bit of an update, particularly when it comes to their UI and full-stack development. I know a space for full-stack developers is growing on here in Codecademy, so I thought I'd throw this out there for anyone looking to showcase their skills. https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesHope to see you all in-person on Wednesday.﻿﻿مرحبًا.سيقام الحدث التالي الذي سنقيمه شخصيًا في كنيسة مترو بابتيست في وسط مانهاتن. يستخدم هذا المبنى كمساحة مجتمعية لمجموعة مساعدة متبادلة اعتدت أن أتطوع فيها في الماضي تسمى Artists Athletes Activists. يساعدون المجتمعات المحرومة والأسر المهاجرة التي تقيم في نظام ملاجئ مدينة نيويورك في الحصول على السكن والطعام والتوظيف والخدمات الاجتماعية. ما زلت على اتصال بهم، لذا فإن أي مساعدة يمكنهم تقديمها موضع ترحيب دائمًا.سيركز الحدث التالي على كيفية تمكن مجتمع Codecademy من الاستفادة من مهاراتهم وخلفياتهم لتبادل الأفكار حول كيفية حل المشكلات الاجتماعية في المجتمع وتقديم تعليم العلوم والتكنولوجيا والهندسة والرياضيات للأسر التي يمكن أن تستفيد منه. مؤخرًا، كنت أقرأ مقالات حول كيفية استخدام بعض المبرمجين لمهاراتهم لإنشاء تطبيقات وأنظمة لمعالجة قضايا تتراوح من ترجمة اللغة إلى بناء قواعد بيانات حول أماكن مخازن الطعام. نظرًا لأن متطوعي وموظفي AAA يتحدثون الإنجليزية والإسبانية والفرنسية والعربية، فإن هذا الحدث سيكون أيضًا حدثًا رائعًا للتواصل بين المبرمجين متعددي اللغات. ﻿﻿https://www.instagram.com/artists.athletes.activists/ سيركز هذا الحدث على ثلاثة مجالات ذات أهمية:1) الكشف عن فوائد البرمجة للأطفال والبالغين الذين يتحدثون لغات مختلفة. اعتقدت أن هذا سيكون موضوعًا رائعًا للتركيز عليه بعد العثور على هذه المقالة حول اللغات المختلفة التي تنشئ أكاديمية خان دروسًا بها. ونظرًا لأن ليس كل شخص يكتب التعليمات البرمجية باللغة الإنجليزية، فيمكن اعتبار هذا تحديًا جيدًا لأي شخص على أكاديمية كود.https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/en-us/articles/226457308-What-languages-is-Khan-Academy-available-in2) مؤخرًا، صادفت مقالاً عن تعاون لجنة الإنقاذ الدولية (IRC) وDocumented لإنشاء منصة رقمية لمساعدة اللاجئين والمهاجرين في الوصول إلى الموارد المتعددة اللغات والمترجمة حتى يتمكنوا من العثور على معلومات حول الوظائف والإسكان والطعام/الملابس. اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented تطلقان موقع Documented.info لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بموارد موثوقة ومتعددة اللغاتتفخر اللجنة الدولية للإنقاذ ومنظمة Documented، وهي غرفة أخبار غير ربحية تقدم تقارير عن مجتمعات المهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك، بالإعلان عن إطلاق Documented.info. صُممت هذه المنصة الرقمية الجديدة لتزويد طالبي اللجوء والمهاجرين في مدينة نيويورك بمعلومات موثوقة ومتعددة اللغات تغطي كل شيء بدءًا من الوصول إلى المأوى وموارد الصحة العقلية وأهلية التوظيف وحقوق العمل إلى كيفية التنقل في عملية اللجوء وإيجاد الدعم القانوني.https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-and-documented-launch-documentedinfo-equip-nyc-asylum-seekers-and-migrants تسمى المنصة Documented.info، والتي تم ربطها أدناه. من ما رأيته، يبدو الأمر وكأنه منصة بسيطة وبديهية للتنقل خلالها، لذلك يمكن لأي شخص التحقق منها بنفسه. بالنظر إلى ما لاحظته في قسم التعاون في مجتمع Codecademy، يمكن أن تكون هذه المنصة بمثابة مصدر إلهام لأي شخص يرغب في إنشاء شيء مماثل.https://www.documented.info/en-us3) هذا العنصر الأخير هو أكثر من مجرد خدمة لطلبها من مجتمع Codecademy. (كما أنه بمثابة فرصة لعرض عملك، لذلك من المرجح أن تحصل على فرصة لإرسال محفظة أو سيرة ذاتية إذا كنت مستعدًا لذلك.) لقد تطوعت عن بُعد لمجموعة غير ربحية تسمى Project Esperanza العام الماضي. لإعطاء ملخص سريع، يساعدون الطلاب الهايتيين المقيمين في جمهورية الدومينيكان حتى يتمكنوا من الحصول على وصول أفضل إلى التعليم بالنظر إلى ما حدث في هايتي في السنوات القليلة الماضية. موقعهم على الويب مرتبط أدناه. تطوع عن بُعدإذا لم تتمكن من قضاء بعض الوقت في بويرتو بلاتا معنا ولكنك ترغب في استخدام وقتك لمساعدة المنظمة، فهناك طرق يمكنك القيام بذلك بها! إليك بعض الطرق التي يمكنك من خلالها المساعدة: تطوير...https://esperanzameanshope.org/volunteer-remotely/ من خلال الوقت الذي أمضيته معهم، ساعدت في تقديم تطوير الويب الأساسي للأطفال في سن المدرسة المتوسطة، ومعظم هذه الدروس جاءت في الواقع من منهج Codecademy. كانت لدي فكرة من قبل لإنشاء برنامج تعليمي افتراضي، لكن الفكرة ذهبت أدراج الرياح عندما نسيت أمرهم لفترة. لم أكن على اتصال بهم منذ ذلك الحين، لكنهم واجهوا مؤخرًا مشكلات مع حسابهم على Instagram وقنوات التواصل الاجتماعي الأخرى. آمل أن يتمكن المجتمع هنا من مساعدتهم في حل هذه المشكلات نظرًا لأن ليس الكثير من الناس يعرفون عن عملهم. إذا أراد أي شخص المساعدة، فإن المنشور الذي يشرح كل شيء مرتبط أدناه مع صفحتهم.https://www.instagram.com/esperanzameanshope/?hl=en  لدي مجموعتان أخريان تحتاجان إلى بعض المساعدة في صفحاتهما. فريق TLC وAfrikana هما مجموعتان أخريان للمساعدة المتبادلة أتطوع فيهما أحيانًا. إنهم لديهم مواقع ويب تحتاج إلى بعض التحديث، وخاصةً عندما يتعلق الأمر بواجهة المستخدم والتطوير الكامل. أعلم أن هناك مساحة للمطورين الكاملين ينمون هنا في Codecademy، لذا فقد فكرت في طرح هذا الموضوع لأي شخص يتطلع إلى عرض مهاراته.https://www.ttlcnyc.org/volunteerhttps://www.afri-kana.org/servicesأتمنى أن أراكم جميعًا شخصيًا يوم الأربعاء.﻿﻿Bonjour.Notre prochain événement en personne aura lieu à la Metro Baptist Church, dans le centre de Manhattan.

(Il sert également d'occasion de présenter votre travail, vous aurez donc probablement l'occasion d'envoyer un portfolio ou un CV si vous le souhaitez.) J'ai fait du bénévolat à distance pour un groupe à but non lucratif appelé Project Esperanza l'année dernière.

Given a recent member's recommendation of hosting an in-person event at a cafe or eatery, I thought this would be a great choice to host such an occasion.  ﻿﻿The topic of the event will focus on discussing ways members of the Codecademy Community can utilize their coding backgrounds to implement solutions to issues affecting the local community, foster STEM mentorship in the youth residing in the area, and assist several non-profits I previously volunteered for. This event could even lead to showcasing your coding portfolios and projects to anyone interested in seeing them.﻿﻿A few blocks away from The Clubhouse Cafe, a vacant property is currently looking for anyone interested in seeking a lease. As someone who recently viewed a Codecademy Community event focused on entrepreneurs, I thought this in-person event could also serve as a chance to discuss how to build a space for coders looking to connect and network. Since The Knowledge House is also based in The Bronx, a tech community in the South Bronx could benefit from the collaboration between the Codecademy Community and larger swaths of the tech sector in the borough.https://www.theknowledgehouse.org/our_story/Finally, Oyate Group is an opportunity for anyone in the Codecademy space to see what ideas they can turn to life with the right support. Based in the South Bronx just like The Knowledge House, Oyate Group is a non-profit that strives to provide resources and solutions to underserved communities seeking to alleviate poverty and invest in entrepreneurial endeavors.

I'm here to share what I've learned through:- Interactive games spotting AI biases- Real cases of GenAI gone wrong (spoiler: it's not just about funny image fails!)- Role-play scenarios that'll make you question default solutions- Open discussions about ethical dilemmas in tech💭 We'll explore real questions like:- When is AI actually NOT the answer?- How can well-intentioned projects have unexpected negative impacts?- What happens when we apply AI in sensitive areas like education or healthcare?- How can we build more inclusive and responsible tech?🌱 This isn't about being perfect - it's about being conscious. Whether you're writing your first line of code or building complex systems, these discussions matter. This is an opportunity to learn together how to drive responsible digital transformation!🗣️ Bring your questions, doubts, and experiences. This is a safe space to reflect and discuss the role we play in shaping tomorrow's tech.","inPersonLocation":null,"tags":[]},"CommunityEvent:15961163":{"__typename":"CommunityEvent","audienceType":"live_room","id":"15961163","title":"Portfolio Building Event! 🎉","type":"YouTube","startDate":"2024-11-07T16:00:00Z","endDate":"2024-11-07T17:00:00Z","url":"https://community.codecademy.com/c/events/join-us-for-the-portfolio-building-event","totalAttendees":81,"descriptionShort":"Hey Coders!
